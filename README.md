Game deployed to URL: https://eliottenos.github.io/eliott-game/

Technologies used: HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript, Query, CURL, AJAX.

Planning/Development:  I first drew up wireframes and user stories in order to get a feel of what it should look like and how the user needs to interact.

I next initiated the authetication process, allowing the user to sign up, sign in, change password and sign out.

Next was the game logic.  This involved everything to do with the actual playing of the game and how that related to the initial authentication.

Next was the connecting to the API which involved PATCH, POST, GET and DELETE.  This updated the API on game status and allowed the user to check game history etc.

Unsolved Problems:  I would have liked to make my page a bit more user friendly with some better use of HTML/CSS/SCSS.  Also, the data retrieved from API could have been expanded and been more easily displayed to the user.
